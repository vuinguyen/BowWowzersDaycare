# BowWowzersDaycare

***Purpose:***
The BowWowzersDaycare project is a Doggy Daycare Management System implemented in Python dictionaries

***Presentation:***
- I gave a lightning talk presentation based on this project.
- Slides for that presentation are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VvKhiGMCWrDGG72EP9VCGxIGRwnQhVgpZ6tQPZhVCxw/edit?slide=id.g34bdea99efd_0_12#slide=id.g34bdea99efd_0_12)
- LinkedIn post about my presentation is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vuinguyen_womenintech-lightningtalks-python-activity-7321592731150016513-umMy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAMnQT0BDFzzF5TdMO5FxMnLiA11fUvveGg)

**Simple Implementation:**

- **bowwowzers_daycare.py**: a simple implementation
- uses dictionaries to add (check in), modify, and remove (check out) dogs in a doggy Daycare

**More Complex Implementation:**
- a more complex implementation using dictionaries wrapped in classes
- **doggy_daycare.py**: contains the following:

  **Dog** class: represents an individual dog in the Daycare

  **Daycare** class: represents the Doggy doggy_daycare

- **bowwowzers_daycare.py**: instantiates objects from the **Dog** and **Daycare** classes to implement the BowWowzers Doggie Daycare Management System.
